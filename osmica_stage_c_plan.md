# Stage C — Give waiters a real identity

Written 17 Aug 2026, overnight, against the state left by Stages A and B.
Nothing in this document has been applied or tested. It is a design.

---

## The problem in one paragraph

Owners authenticate through Supabase Auth and arrive with a JWT, so the database
knows who they are. Waiters do not. Every waiter request runs as `anon`, and the
only thing separating one waiter from another is a 4-digit PIN that the *server*
checks — which means the PIN is a network credential, guessable in 10,000 tries,
and `login_waiter_by_pin(cafe_id, pin)` will happily tell an attacker *which*
waiter they just became. Stage A made that expensive (rate limiting) and stopped
the credentials leaking. It could not make it stop being the design.

Stage C replaces it: every waiter gets a real Supabase identity bound to their
device, and the PIN stops being something the network will answer questions
about.

## What it fixes, concretely

| today | after Stage C |
|---|---|
| A stolen invite link + PIN works from any device | The credential lives in one browser; a forwarded link is inert |
| `login_waiter_by_pin` maps café + PIN → a waiter, so you needn't know whose PIN you're guessing | The function no longer exists |
| PIN is 10,000 guesses against the network | PIN never leaves the device |
| Waiters have no `auth.uid()`, so RLS cannot express "your own rows" | Every waiter has one — Stage D becomes writable |

That last row is the real prize. **Stage D is impossible until this lands**, and
Stage D is what closes the remaining read exposure.

---

## The design

A waiter opening an invite link calls `signInAnonymously()`. Supabase issues a
real user with a real JWT and a device-scoped refresh token stored in that
browser. `link_waiter_to_auth(token)` then binds that user id to the waiter row
and consumes the invite token.

From then on the waiter is authenticated to the database as themselves, on that
device, indefinitely — the refresh token renews silently.

The PIN becomes a **local unlock**: a gate on the app in that browser, checked
against a hash in local storage, never sent anywhere. This is the model banking
apps use, and it keeps the 4-digit UX that suits a phone behind a bar.

### Be honest about what the PIN then is

Once the PIN is a local check, **it is no longer a security boundary.** Anyone
holding the unlocked phone can bypass it with devtools, because the session that
actually authenticates is sitting in the same browser storage. It protects
against a colleague picking up your phone, not against an attacker who has it.

That is a *downgrade* in what the PIN protects and an *upgrade* in overall
security, and both halves are true. The thing that protects the account becomes
possession of the device, which is a far better credential than four digits.
Worth saying out loud so nobody later assumes the PIN is doing more than it is.

---

## Four steps, in order

Same discipline as Stage A: additive first, destructive last, each step verified
before the next.

### C1 — Add the identity column and the linking function *(additive, zero risk)*

`migrations/014_stage_c_waiter_identity.sql`, already written.

- `waiters.auth_user_id uuid UNIQUE` referencing `auth.users`
- `link_waiter_to_auth(p_token text)`, `SECURITY DEFINER`, reads `auth.uid()`
  from the caller's JWT, binds it to the waiter row matching the token, and
  rotates the invite token so it cannot be reused

Changes nothing that exists. The app does not call it yet.

**Requires a dashboard setting:** Authentication → Providers → *Anonymous
sign-ins* must be enabled, on both projects. Without it `signInAnonymously()`
returns an error and C2 silently does nothing.

### C2 — Waiters start signing in *(additive; the app still works exactly as now)*

Build v4.37, written on branch `stage-c`.

On completing an invite, after the PIN is set, the client calls
`signInAnonymously()` and then `link_waiter_to_auth(token)`. **Failure is
non-fatal** — it logs and continues, because the PIN login path is untouched and
still works. So a waiter whose linking fails is not locked out; they simply have
no identity yet and can be re-invited.

This step gives waiters identities without changing a single user-visible
behaviour. Nothing depends on the identity yet.

**One mandatory guard ships with it.** `init()` at `osmica.html:1389` calls
`sb.auth.getSession()` and routes *any* session into `enterOwnerApp()`. An
anonymously signed-in waiter has a session. Without a guard, every linked waiter
lands in the owner's admin panel — with the owner's column grants — on their next
app open. The guard is `!session.user.is_anonymous`, and it is not optional or
deferrable.

### C3 — The PIN moves to the device *(behavioural change)*

*Scope rewritten 22 Aug 2026, after `dev/016` and v4.39. The original three
bullets are still the goal; what changed is that three prerequisites now sit in
front of them, and one of those is a hard safety gate rather than a nicety.*

**The goal, unchanged:**

- PIN entry checks a locally stored hash (WebCrypto, PBKDF2) instead of calling
  `verify_waiter_pin`
- A linked waiter with a valid session skips café + PIN resolution entirely; the
  app knows who they are from the JWT
- `pin_hash` stops being written

#### The gate — all four must hold before C3a starts

| | check |
|---|---|
| v4.39 deployed to production | the version marker reads v4.39 on the live site |
| every active waiter linked | the query below returns `linked = true` for all |
| the owner can unlink (C3a) | shipped and tested — see below for why this is a gate |
| the admin panel shows linked state (C3b) | so the gate above can be read at a glance |

```sql
select name, auth_user_id is not null as linked from public.waiters order by name;
```

A waiter without `auth_user_id` has no session to unlock, so for them C3 removes
the only way in. Before v4.39 this gate was unreachable in principle: the
`recover` branch never linked, and `joined_at` is never cleared, so any waiter
past their first PIN could not be linked through the UI at all.

#### C3a — Owner unlink-and-reissue 🔴 SAFETY GATE, do this first

**Why it is a gate, not a feature.** Today a waiter who clears their browser
data is inconvenienced: the session is gone, but PIN login still gets them in,
and SQL can rescue them. C3 moves PIN checking to a local hash and C4 deletes
`login_waiter_by_pin` and `verify_waiter_pin` outright. After that, a cleared
browser means no session, no local hash and no PIN path. The only way back is a
fresh invite — and a fresh invite **cannot bind**, because `link_waiter_to_auth`
requires `auth_user_id IS NULL` (`014:71`) and theirs is set. That is a
permanent lockout with no self-service path and no owner-facing fix.

**Migration `017` — `owner_unlink_waiter(p_waiter_id uuid)`**, `SECURITY
DEFINER`, `SET search_path = public, extensions, pg_temp`:

- verify the caller owns that waiter's café with `owns_cafe(cafe_id)`, and
  return without touching anything if not — the same shape as
  `owner_list_waiters`
- `auth_user_id = null` — releases the binding so a new device can claim
- `joined_at = null` — sends the next invite down the `setup` branch, which is
  the only branch that can establish a *new* PIN. After C3 the old PIN lives
  only on the device that is gone, so `recover` would ask for something the
  waiter cannot produce.
- `pin_hash = null` — until C4 drops the column; the old hash authenticates a
  PIN nobody has any more
- `invite_token = gen_random_uuid()::text` — the old link dies with the old
  binding
- return the new token so the owner can send it immediately

Grant `EXECUTE` to `authenticated` only. The ownership check inside is what
authorises, not the role — trap 6 and the reason `set_waiter_pin` had to be
dropped in `008`.

**Client:** an "Odveži uređaj" action in the admin panel, next to 💬, that calls
it and shows the resulting link. Confirm before firing — it logs the waiter out
of a device they may still be holding.

**Test on dev before trusting it:** link a waiter, unlink them, confirm
`linked = false`, then complete the new invite on a clean profile and confirm
`linked = true` again. That round trip is the thing C3 depends on.

#### C3b — Show linked, not just activated

The admin panel reads "activated" from `joined_at`, which is set the moment
anyone picks a PIN and never cleared. `auth_user_id` is what governs whether a
waiter can write, and the panel never shows it. On 22 Aug five dev waiters read
as activated and none of them could raise a swap request.

Without this, C3's gate is checkable only in SQL, and the owner has no way to
see that someone is locked out. Add it to `owner_list_waiters`' return set and
render it distinctly from activated — two different states, two different fixes.

#### C3c — Stop swallowing link failures

`osmica.html:1619-1626` turns `invalid_token` and any unexpected result into a
`console.warn`. Nobody reads a console. Today that degrades to a read-only
waiter; after C3 it means somebody cannot get in at all, and the screen will say
nothing about why.

- `invalid_token` → "Ova poveznica više ne vrijedi. Zatraži novu od vlasnika."
- `already_linked` → only benign when the uid already belongs to *this* waiter.
  Check that before treating it as success, or a second claim in one browser
  silently binds nobody, exactly as it did with Ana Anić on 22 Aug.
- `no_session` → anonymous sign-in failed; retry rather than continue.

#### C3d — Make the write-refused error specific

The client shows one toast — *"Greška. Pokušajte ponovo."* — for every failed
insert, which is why a correctly-enforced policy and a broken app read
identically on screen. A 403 from `sr_waiter_insert` has a specific meaning:
this device is not linked. Say so, and point at the fix.

#### C3e — The behavioural change itself

> ✅ **Done. Client v4.42, deployed to production 24 Aug 2026** (commit
> `32cb894`, marker verified live and byte-identical to HEAD).
> `TaskList_2026-08-23.md` is the file that executed C3e, C3f and C4 together,
> and carries every recorded reading.
> Two things below changed while it was written; both are recorded at the top of
> that file and repeated here so this document stops contradicting itself.
>
> **1. The keypad stays.** Check 2 of C3f says a waiter with a live session sees
> "no PIN prompt at all", and check 1 says they unlock with their PIN. Those
> cannot both hold. Resolved in favour of the keypad: the session decides *who
> you are*, the PIN decides *whether the app opens on this phone right now*, and
> that is the only job this document ever claimed for it. Check 2 below is
> rewritten in the task list to match.
>
> **2. `setup` and `recover` are collapsed into one path.** The warning below —
> write the local hash in both branches — was answered by removing the branch.
> v4.42 routes on whether *this browser* holds a local hash for that waiter,
> not on `joined_at`. Asking a returning waiter for their old PIN proved nothing
> anyway: the invite token is the credential either way, and
> `link_waiter_to_auth` refuses any row that is already bound.

Only now, with the gate satisfied:

- derive a PBKDF2 hash of the PIN with WebCrypto at PIN-set time, store hash and
  salt in `localStorage`
- PIN entry compares locally; `verify_waiter_pin` is no longer called
- a linked waiter with a live session skips café resolution and PIN entry
  entirely — the JWT already says who they are
- stop writing `pin_hash`

> 🔴 **Write the local hash in *both* invite branches.** v4.39 exists because
> `linkWaiterIdentity()` was called from `setup` and not from `recover`. If the
> hash write lands in one branch only, the identical bug reappears in a new
> place and is just as invisible: the waiter gets in, and fails later for
> reasons the screen does not explain. Whatever C3 writes at link time, write it
> in both, and test the `recover` path explicitly rather than assuming it.

#### C3f — Verification

> ✅ **All five passed on dev 24 Aug 2026, as checks 3.1–3.9 of
> `TaskList_2026-08-23.md`; production re-verified as that file's step 5.**
>
> **Check 2 is rewritten, and this document was wrong.** It asked for "no PIN
> prompt at all", which contradicts check 1 asking the same waiter to unlock
> with their PIN. Resolved in favour of the keypad — see decision 1 under C3e.
> What was actually verified: the session resolves *who you are* with no café
> chooser and no round trip, and the keypad then decides whether the app opens
> on this phone.
>
> **Check 3 needed rewriting too.** `pin_hash is not null` cannot show "no *new*
> values" on a row that already carries an old one, and v4.42 neither writes nor
> clears the column. On production Mara's hash read `true` until a 🔓 nulled it.
> The sound form is comparing `md5(pin_hash)` across the PIN set, or reading the
> column on a row the owner has just unlinked.
>
> **Check 4 is the one C4 was gated on** and it passed on all six of its own
> steps, on Ana Anić: 🔓, old link refused, new link claimed in a clean browser,
> row rebound, swap request written. Production repeated it on Mara — `joined_at`
> at `00:37:08.546Z`, swap request written at `00:37:17.524Z`, nine seconds later.

1. A linked waiter opens the app offline and unlocks with their PIN.
2. A linked waiter with a live session opens the app and lands on **their own
   keypad** — name resolved from `auth.uid()`, no café chooser, no "which waiter
   is this" round trip.
3. No *new* `pin_hash` is written. Compare the hash across a PIN set, or read the
   column on a freshly unlinked row.
4. A waiter unlinked by the owner in C3a completes a fresh invite, sets a new
   PIN, and can raise a request. **This is the recovery path C4 makes
   irreversible — it must pass before C4 runs.**
5. Every check above run on the `recover` branch as well as `setup`.

### C4 — Remove the old surface *(destructive, irreversible)*

> ✅ **Done. Migration `018` applied to both projects 24 Aug 2026** — dev first,

Once every waiter is linked and C3 is live — and **only** once C3f check 4 has
passed, the owner-unlink round trip. C4 deletes the last fallback, so if
recovery is broken when C4 runs, it is broken permanently and a single cleared
browser costs a staff member their access for good:

- `DROP FUNCTION login_waiter_by_pin` — the enumeration oracle
- `DROP FUNCTION verify_waiter_pin` — the second oracle
- `DROP TABLE pin_attempts` — the rate limiter exists only to protect those two
- `ALTER TABLE waiters DROP COLUMN pin_hash` — nothing reads it
- `DROP FUNCTION is_pin_locked` and remove `pinFailureMessage()` from the client

After C4, the entire "guess a PIN, discover who you became" surface is gone, and
migration 009 can be deleted from the repo as historical.

> ✅ **True as of 24 Aug 2026.** `009` is kept in the repo rather than deleted:
> it is the record of why the two oracles were rate-limited instead of removed
> for as long as they were.

## Consequences you should decide on, not discover

### 1. One device per waiter

An anonymous session lives in one browser. A waiter who wants the app on a phone
*and* a tablet needs two invites, and would be two `auth_user_id`s — which the
`UNIQUE` constraint forbids on one row.

**Options:** accept one device each (simplest, matches "personal devices only");
or drop `UNIQUE` and allow several identities per waiter (more moving parts, and
Stage D's policies get slightly harder).

**My recommendation:** accept one device. Add the second only when someone asks.

### 2. Clearing browser data means a re-invite

There is no self-service recovery any more. Today a waiter reopens their invite
link and enters their PIN. After Stage C the link is consumed and the PIN is
local, so both are gone with the browser data.

The owner reissues from the admin panel — which already has the 💬 button — and
the waiter sets a new PIN. That is a one-minute fix for the owner and no worse
than a forgotten password, but it does mean **the owner must be reachable.**

**Alternative:** keep a server-side recovery path (waiter proves identity with a
PIN, gets re-bound). That reintroduces exactly the oracle C4 deletes. Not
recommended.


> ⚠️ **Updated 22 Aug — "the owner re-invites" was not implementable.** The 💬
> button rebuilds a URL from the *existing* token (`osmica.html:2866`); nothing
> rotates a token on demand. And `link_waiter_to_auth` requires
> `auth_user_id IS NULL` (`014:71`), so an already-bound row returns
> `invalid_token` — not `already_linked`, which fires only when the *caller's*
> uid is bound. The client counts only `ok`/`already_linked` as success, so the
> failure is a console warning and nothing else.
>
> The decision stands; **C3a is its implementation**, and it is a gate on C3
> rather than a follow-up, because C4 removes the PIN fallback that currently
> makes this survivable.

### 3. It degrades the dev identity switcher

Today the switcher (v4.30) becomes any waiter on one phone by writing a local
override. After C3 that stops being enough — becoming a waiter means holding
*their* session, and one browser holds one anonymous identity.

The switcher still works for the owner and for pre-C3 flows, but per-waiter
switching on a single device conflicts with the entire point of device binding.

**Options:** accept that dev testing needs several browser profiles (private
windows work); or keep the switcher working on dev only, by leaving the PIN path
alive there. Dev already diverges deliberately on anonymous writes, so one more
documented divergence is defensible.

**My recommendation:** private windows. Adding a second permanent divergence to
dev to preserve a convenience is how dev stops being a faithful test of
production.

### 4. Anonymous users are real users

They count toward the project's user total and appear in Authentication → Users.
Six waiters is nothing, but a bug that signs in on every page load would create
thousands. The linking call happens **once**, on invite completion, and the guard
is that a waiter with a session never reaches it.

---

## What Stage C does *not* fix

Anonymous reads of names, colours, shift patterns and schedules stay open. Stage
C only creates the identities; **Stage D writes the policies that use them.**
Doing C without D leaves the exposure exactly where it is today — so C is only
worth doing as the first half of a pair.

---

## Verification, per step

Never on the strength of the app still working — that proves the policies are not
too tight, not that they are tight enough.

- **C1** — `select set_waiter_pin_by_token` unaffected; `link_waiter_to_auth`
  with no session returns `no_session`; with a bad token returns `invalid_token`.
- **C2** — complete an invite on dev, then
  `select name, auth_user_id from waiters where name like 'Eva%'` shows a uuid.
  Then **close and reopen the app**: the waiter must land on the waiter screen,
  not the owner's. That single check is what proves the `is_anonymous` guard.
- **C3** — a linked waiter opens the app offline and unlocks with the PIN; the
  network is never asked.
- **C4** — `POST /rpc/login_waiter_by_pin` returns 404.

---

## Where this leaves the threat model

After C and D, someone who reads the whole source, extracts the publishable key
and pokes at the API can enumerate nothing, read nothing and write nothing. The
key becomes what it was always meant to be: routing, not authorisation.

The remaining risks are the ordinary ones — a stolen unlocked phone, a
compromised owner email — and Stage E addresses those with 2FA and login alerts.
